# Gulp & Bower Start KIT

This is a starting from scratch template for your project in Dowell.
Unlike the regular "gulp-template" we use, this one doesn't utilize CoffeeScript + has SCSS syntax instead of SASS.
It also runs your stylesheet files through gulp-autoprefixer for better browser support.

## QUICK START

Clone repository to your local machine

      git clone git@git.dowell.com.ua:shared/gulp-scss.git

      or:

      http://git.dowell.com.ua/shared/gulp-scss.git

Install global dependencies:

      npm install -g gulp bower

Install packages:

      npm install
      
Go to package.json file and change ProjectName.

All your source files located in assets directory by default.

Run to build application:

      gulp build

You can see 'build/' directory in the root of your project.

Open **index.html** file to make sure everything is alright

Enjoy!
